<h2 id="viennats">What is ViennaTS?</h2>

<p>The Vienna Topography Simulator is an open source tool developed by the Institute of Microelectronics at TU Wien, which provides high performance simulation abilities. It uses a highly performant levelset representation to translate and modify surfaces. Ray tracing capabilities enable the simulation of modern semiconductor fabrication processes. In the long run, it aims to provide a complete and easily extensible, free to use, open source process simulation framework.</p>

<h2>What can it do?</h2>

<p>Some examples including explanations of ViennaTS' capabilities can be found in <a href="#content/examples.html">the Examples section</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, ViennaTS is capable of simulating several different semiconductor fabrication processes, such as chemical vapour deposition, atomic layer deposition, several etch processes or composites thereof, such as the Bosch process. These processes are described by their respective models, which encapsulate all the necessary information about each process. New models for not currently supported processes can be added easily, allowing anyone to model even complex processes without the need for expensive proprietry software.</p>

<p>High resolution three-dimensional simulations can be conducted easily. The below image shows a complex modern gate stack etch sequence with several different materials in three dimensions.</p>
